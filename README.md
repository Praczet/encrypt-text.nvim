# Encrypt-text

**encrypt-text** is a lua plugin for LunarVim for encryptin and decrypting text (I have no idea if it does work in pure Neovim).

## Intro

I have created this plugin (and let it be know this is my the very first plugin) to have functionality similar to [ QOwnNotes ](https://www.qownnotes.org/). Which is a feature to encrypt text in md file. So this plugin basically encrypt (and decrypt) the text (starting from the second line).
The first line is just the **Title**

# Usage

> :Encrypt passkey
> :Decrypt passkey

or without passkey

> :Encrypt
> :Decrypt

In this case you will be asked for encryption's password

# ToDo

Clean, add installation process and test it (which is almost done)
